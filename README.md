# VR Debug Drawing Tool

## Introduction
Welcome to the VR Debug Drawing Tool project page. This project is an addition to a VR debug tool built in Unity 2017.4 LTS, aiming to enhance the debugging experience for Unity developers by allowing them to draw and take notes directly within the VR environment. This tool is particularly useful for developers who want to debug without taking off their VR headsets, thus maintaining immersion and focus.

## Project Overview

### What We Did
We implemented a VR drawing tool that integrates with an existing debugging system. Initially, the tool was designed to support simple drawing and erasing in a few colors, but it has since evolved to include additional features such as undo/redo functionality, stamps, and 3D pen/eraser models.

### Why It Matters
Triangular Pixels wanted to provide a solution that would help Unity developers debug their VR games more effectively. By enabling developers to keep their headsets on and interact directly within the game environment, this tool minimizes disruptions and enhances the debugging process.

### How It Works
The VR Debug Drawing Tool is built using C# and the XR Interaction Toolkit in Unity 2017.4 LTS. This ensures compatibility with various VR headsets and Unity versions. The tool, along with the drawing feature, is packaged as a Unity asset.

## Key Features

### Drawing
- **Drawing Options**: Start and stop drawing using either the draw button on the drawing panel or the triggers on your VR handset.
- **Physical Input**: Toggle physical input for a more natural drawing experience.
- **Editing Tools**: Includes undo, redo, clear all, and eraser functions to manage your drawings efficiently.

### Aesthetics
- **Color Selection**: Choose from four available colors (Red, Green, Blue, White) via the aesthetics panel.
- **Brush Size**: Adjust the size of your paintbrush with the '+' and '-' buttons.

### Stamps
- **Adding Stamps**: Easily add stamps to the scene using the stamps panel. Customize stamps by selecting different sizes and adding new ones.
- **Creating Stamps**: Instructions for importing and creating custom stamps are provided to enhance flexibility.

### Advanced Features
- **Line Opacity**: Temporarily hide lines for a cleaner workspace.
- **Undo/Redo**: Maintain a stack of actions for easy reversal or reinstatement of changes.
- **Eraser**: Remove specific points on lines, splitting them as needed to maintain continuity.

## Development Process

### Planning and Sprints
Our development was organized into ten two-week sprints, with regular client meetings and reviews to ensure progress and alignment with requirements. Feedback from clients was incorporated into subsequent sprints, allowing for iterative improvements and feature additions.
